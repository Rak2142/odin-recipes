    <p>At the end of the day, wouldn't you much rather just give them,
        kids, husband, wife, or all of the above, what they want? Nothing beats
        an all time favorite, crispy breaded chicken strips, paired with our 
        honey mustard sauce.  </p>

    <p>Marinated in buttermilk, seasoned to perfection and fried to crispy 
        perfection. A versatile dish that goes great on its own, served on a salad
        or finger food for the game day. </p>
