    <h1>Homemade Honey Mustard</h1>

    <p>Who doesn't love a good dipping sauce? This honey mustard will compliment
        our chicken tender recipe nicely, as well as any meat dishes you want
        to try it with. With its sweet, savory, and creamy flavors
        you will have the whole neighborhood asking where you get it. 
    </p>

    <p>If you check the ingredients for any store bought sauce it probably 
        has quite a few things that you have never even heard of before.
        Our recipe takes just a few ingredients and is very simple to make. Once
        you give it a try, you'll never go back to store bought.
